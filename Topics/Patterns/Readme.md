# Steps to Develop Logic for Pattern Problems

## 1. Understand the Grid:
- Visualize the grid with rows and columns. For example, in a 7x7 grid, you have 7 rows (0 to 6) and 7 columns (0 to 6).

## 2. Determine the Desired Pattern:
- Sketch the pattern on paper or visualize it.
- Identify which cells should contain specific characters (e.g., `*`) and which should contain spaces (` `).

## 3. Identify Conditions:
- Break down the pattern into conditions based on row and column indices.
- For example:
  - **Vertical Lines:** Check for specific columns.
  - **Horizontal Lines:** Check for specific rows.

## 4. Write the Conditions:
- Use logical operators (`and`, `or`) to combine multiple conditions.
- Ensure the conditions correctly match the desired pattern.

## 5. Implement Nested Loops:
- Use nested loops to iterate over each cell in the grid.
- Apply the conditions within the inner loop to determine whether to place a specific character or a space.

## 6. Construct the String:
- Build the pattern line by line by appending characters to a result string.
- Add newline characters to separate rows.

### Example Program:

```python
result_str = ""

for row in range(0, 7):
    for column in range(0, 7):
        if (((column == 1 or column == 5) and row != 0) or ((row == 0 or row == 3) and (column > 1 and column < 5))):
            result_str = result_str + "*"
        else:
            result_str = result_str + " "
    result_str = result_str + "\n"

print(result_str)
```

Iteration Breakdown

Row 0:

Columns 0 to 6:

  Column 0: Not part of any condition, add space.
  
  Column 1: Not part of any condition, add space.
  
  Column 2: Part of the top horizontal line (row == 0 and column > 1 and column < 5), add *.
  
  Column 3: Part of the top horizontal line, add *.
  
  Column 4: Part of the top horizontal line, add *.
  
  Column 5: Not part of any condition, add space.
  
  Column 6: Not part of any condition, add space.

Result after row 0: " *** \n"
